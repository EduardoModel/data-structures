# Data Structures (with Typescript)
This folder is just for easy and fast consult of the concepts and implementation details
from the most diverse data structures that can be used.

## Stack
A [**Stack**](/stack) is like a real world stack, were new stuff will always be added and removed from the top.
It follows the LIFO (last in, first out) rule.

## Queue
A [**Queue**](/queue) works also like a real world queue, where stuff will be removed from the front and added at the back.
It follows the FIFO(first in, first out) rule.

## Lists
[**Lists**](/linked-lists) is a way to store the elements in memory and each node knows, at least, where is the next node.

## Trees
[**Trees**](/trees) are a way to save elements within nodes following a predefined hierarchy to insert them into this data structure.

## Graphs
[**Graphs**](/graphs) are a way to structurate elements like nodes (vertices) that point to other nodes through (edges).
They can be directed or undirected and the edges can or can't have wheigts as well.
