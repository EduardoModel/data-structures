# Stack
A Stack works just like a real world stack, where the elements will be added and removed form the top of the stack.

The common uses for a stack are basically:
 - When doing an lexical analisis to store some reserved tokens, like parenthesis, curled or normal brackets.
 - Organizing function calls or actions, that were taken.
