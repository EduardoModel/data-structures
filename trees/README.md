# Trees
A tree is a data type that recreates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
The strucutre itself reselmbes a loot of an fractal due the repeating patterns that can be found inside it.

This data structure is basically defined as a collection of nodes, where each node is an entity containing a value and a list of references to other nodes, called children and
the entry point of the tree is called the **root node**. And within the tree no reference is duplicated and none points to the root.
This avoid a loot of issues for more robust types of tree, where strategies are applied to keep the whole structure balanced.
